   "description":"Tonbokiri (蜻蛉切) is one of Three Great Spears of Japan created by the famed swordsmith Fujiwara Masazane, said to be wielded by the daimyō Honda Tadakatsu, a leading general of Tokugawa Ieyasu.The spear derives its name from the myth that a dragonfly landed on its blade and was instantly cut in two. Thus tonbo (Japanese for dragonfly) and kiri (Japanese for cutting), translating this spear's name as Dragonfly Cutter.",
